# Catch the thief - Project 1
By Sara Graveline

In this game, the player's goal is to not let the thief steal the diamond which are at the bottom of the sea. The player is represented with the police badge because they will be catching the thief. The thiefs are represented by a thief icon which appears in different sizes, different speed and from different places on the x-axis.

To play the game, a player just have to click anywhere on the start screen of the game and then the game will start. However, if a thief makes her/his way all the way to the bottom of the screen (near the diamond), the game stops. Whenever the police/player catches a thief, they receive scores. 1 score per thief. When the game stops, the player can see how much score he/she got before they lost the game.

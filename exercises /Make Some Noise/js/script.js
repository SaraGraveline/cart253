/**
E6 - Make Some Noise
Sara Graveline

This exercise is to explore sounds in p5.js. Through this excercise, I created a sound cursor which I use in my final project.
Becuase my final project theme is christmas, I used the song silent night. As the song starts, the circles starts to bounce with the rhythm of the song.
To create more christmas environment, I used random function on the stroke of these circles.
This cursor will be used on a landing page and the ending page of the game where the user will have to click on different buttons.

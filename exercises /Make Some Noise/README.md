# E6 - Make Some Noise
Sara Graveline

This exercise is to explore sounds in p5.js. Through this exercise, I created a sound cursor which I use in my final project. Because my final project theme is Christmas, I used the song silent night. As the song starts, the circles starts to bounce with the rhythm of the song. To create more Christmas environment, I used random function on the stroke of these circles. This cursor will be used on a landing page and the ending page of the game where the user will have to click on different buttons.

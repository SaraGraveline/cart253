#Exercise: Love, actually

Goal: Don't get caught by negativity.
This project is mostly based on functions and how to use them. The main goal of this game is to, `not get caught be the negativity,` which is around us all the time.
The user have to try to get their way to the positivity by using the arrow keys and while avoiding all the negativity on their path.
The negativity are the bounce pink balls.
The positivity is the purple ball which moves very randomly and is chaotic in a way.
The user-control circle is the yellow circle which moves with the arrow keys on the keyword.
To start the game the user has to press on the mouse to move to the simulation state.
If the user-control circle touches the pink circles, the game ends and the following message, `Oops, you failed :(.` And the user has to reload the page to start again.
However, if the user successfully find its way and touches the purple circle, the game ends with this message, `Hooray!!! you won`.

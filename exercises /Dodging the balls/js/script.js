/**
Activity 04: Dodging COVID-19
Sara Graveline

The idea for this activity is to make a simulation of COVID-19. The red circle represents covid-19.
The goal of this simulation is to let the user control their circle with the position of the mouse.
When the Covid-19/red circle comes in contact with the user circle, the simulation stops.

Plan:
  * Create covid-19 circle and make it move
  * Make the covid-19 return back with if statment
  * Create the user circle
  * Check the circle overlap
  * Hide the cursor by using noCursor

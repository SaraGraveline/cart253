# I like to move it

Sara Graveline

This project uses variables to create a happy face. It uses constrain () to control the speed and size of the shapes. It uses map() on the background color to change the color. As for the fill in these three shapes, it uses mouseX and mouseY variables. To create the trapezoid, it uses beginShape.

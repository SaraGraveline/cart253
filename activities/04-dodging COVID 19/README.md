# Activity 04: Dodging COVID-19
Sara Graveline

The idea for this activity is to make a simulation of COVID-19. The red circle represents covid-19 and while circle represents the user circle.
The goal of this simulation is to let the user control their circle with their position of the mouse. However, when the Covid-19 circle comes in contact with the user circle, the simulation stops and so does the static background. This code uses variables, javascript object, if statements, noLoop, noCursor, loop, and dist() function to create this simulation.

/**
Project 2: Game 2 - Catching Ornaments
Sara Graveline

This is the Second game of my final game. This game is where the player will need to catch the ornaments before they touch the ground.
To win, the player needs to catch 30. However, if any of ornaments touches the ground, the game will be over and player has to restart again.
Because I used different classes in my first game - collecting gifts, so I decided to go with the first method we learned, in the start of this class.

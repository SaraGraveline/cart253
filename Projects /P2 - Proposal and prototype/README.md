#Helping Jungkook - Artist Statement
Sara Graveline

Helping Jungkook is a game about Christmas. Because of covid and school term, everyone is so busy with their work and job. No one has time to slow down these days and enjoy life. Most of the parents are either working or worrying about their children’s future that they forget to enjoy these beautiful times. Students are busy with getting everything ready so they can apply to colleges or universities. No matter what, everyone is so worried or concerned about their future that they don’t realize when these holidays go by. So, as a student who has been through a rough semester, I want to enjoy this break and catch up with time, rather than chase it over and over.

The idea behind this game is to let the user realize that they should stop doing everything else and just focus on this break. While the user is collecting gifts or catching the ornaments, this game could trigger some old memories of the last time when they were worry-free and were living in the moment. By helping Jungkook, I want the user to be excited and motivated to enjoy this Christmas/holidays with their families and create some amazing memories.

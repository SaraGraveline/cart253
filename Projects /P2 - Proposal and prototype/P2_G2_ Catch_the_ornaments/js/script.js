/**************************************************
Project 2 - Catch the ornaments
Sara Graveline

The player has to help Jungkook with catching all the ornaments. Don't let them touch the ground becuase it will break if it does. And after catching 25 of them, you can go back to the main (matching game) and complete that game.

# Project 2: Game 1 - collecting gifts
Sara Graveline

This is the first actual game of my final game. I wanted to do a snake game but I couldn't fully understood how it worked so I mixed thing and created a semi snake game where it needs to avoid the red bricks while collecting the gifts.
I wanted to add more obstacle but I ran out of time.

The snake is the gift train that collect present when it touches them. However, if the gift train touches the red brick wall, the game ends.
The goal of the game is to collect 20 gifts and move on to the next game, game 2 - catching ornaments. The user can't play the other games, if she/he can't complete this game.

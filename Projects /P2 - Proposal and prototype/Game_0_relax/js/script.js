/**
Project 2: Game 0 - Relax
Sara Graveline

This game is the beginning of the final 3 games that the user will be playing to help Jungkook throw a Christmas party.
This relax game is the starting point because with everything that we went through with covid, being online, and not being able to live a normal life is very hard.
So this game lets the user take a few minutes to just relax and breath without any concerns or worry. And whenever the user want to go on and start playing the game, she/he can click the link which leads to the game 1 - collecting gifts.

The main goal of game 0 is to play with sounds. So I created a sound cursor, inspired by Lllucas's sound visualization.
When the user presses any key on their keyword, silent night starts playing and the circles of the cursor starts to bounce with the rhythm of the song.

# Project 2: Game 4_ ending
Sara Graveline

This game is same as the beginning but only the display test is changed to words of goodbye. I wanted to do a fully own game with matching color but I ran out of time and this is what I can do.
We learned so much this semester so its hard to grab to everything when you are slow learner.

This again provide as alone space for the user to take their quick break by watch the circles dance to the slient night.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!.

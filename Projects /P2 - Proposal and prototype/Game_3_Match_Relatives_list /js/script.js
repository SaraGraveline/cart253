/**
Game 3 _ Matching Relative Colors
Sara Graveline

This game, I couldn't complete because I ran out of time. However, the main idea is here where the user would try to match the cards to find a matching pairing.
Also there is nothing changed here since the last feedback and alot of code is from codepen.

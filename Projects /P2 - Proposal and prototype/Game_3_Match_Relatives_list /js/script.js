/**
Help Jungkook with Christmas - Project 2
Sara Graveline

This is the main script.js where I will bring all of my different games together to make it a one game. This is where I wil do my final project 2.
But for now, this documnet has the details of the main game called the matching game. And the other links are to the other games which will be added to this document later one.

The main theme of this game is to help Jungkook with christmax by playing only the main game if player doesn't flip the wrong cards 7 times.
Otherwise, the player will have to complete more games depending on how many time he/she gets 7 wrong cards continuously.
